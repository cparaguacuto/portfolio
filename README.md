# Portfolio

This repository is created in order to showcase a highlight of my data analytics projects ranging from financial valuations to database management

## About Me

I am a data analyst with a passion for uncovering insights and trends in data. I have experience in a variety of tools and techniques for data exploration and visualization.

## Projects

- [WACC & Company Valuation](https://github.com/cparaguacuto/portfolio/blob/main/2021F_FIN325_Final%20Project_WACC%20%26%20Company%20Valuation_Excel%20Part.xlsx)
  - I performed the procedure of creating a FCFF model spreadsheet for a listed company, to measure Enterprise value and intrinsic value of the firm, and to evaluate the firmâ€™s performance with financial ratios.
  - The model was constructed using the 10-K reports of Amtech Systems, Inc., a semiconductor and capital equipment production company
  - Other methods and techniques used consist of relative valuation methods, profitability ratios, and project assumptions based on market research
  - The report included a investment proposal that valuated the stock at an $11.20 target price

- [Four Corners](https://github.com/cparaguacuto/portfolio/blob/main/FourCorners.xlsx)
  - Constructed a simulation for financial planning and completed a managerial report that consisted 
  - The data sources used in this project
  - A Monte Carlo simulation was utilized to consider potential changes in salary growth and market fluctuations to gain a more comprehensive understanding of financial projections for employees
  - I determined an annual investment rate of 9% which creates a probability of 98% for achieving the $1,000,000 goal within 25 years and the simulation results also indicate that the portfolio could potentially be worth as much as $2,744,843, which evidently surpasses the $1,000,000 
   
- [SQL Database Creation](https://github.com/cparaguacuto/portfolio/blob/main/FourCorners.xlsx)
  - I developed a business/organizational case study and designed a 
    database that met the needs of my business or organization
  - The source material used in the database is translated from my own ER diagram designed to fit the business rules of a streaming platform 
  - I created tables with their respective columns, appropriate datatype, and constraints 
  
- [SQL Queries](https://github.com/cparaguacuto/portfolio/blob/main/FourCorners.xlsx)
  - I performed 29 different queries on a SQL script file
  - The human_resources script file contained information regarding employees, departments, locations, countries, regions, and salaries
  - Used left joins, inner joins, group bys, order bys, else statements, case whens, mathematical operations, and more
    
- [American Airlines Stock Visualization](https://github.com/cparaguacuto/portfolio/blob/main/StockVisualization.py)
  - Constructed a time series chart for American Airlines stock 
  - It was coded in python using libraries and APIs such as pandas datareader, datetime, alpha vantage, json, and matplotlib
  - Downloaded stock market data using an Alpha Vantage API into a CSV and sorted it into a pandas data frame, and ultimately plotting a time series chart using matplotlib
